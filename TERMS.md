# Terms & Conditions

_Last updated: March 7, 2024_

By installing or using the Väinämöinen Moderation Helper (the "App"), you agree to the following terms:

1. **Community Suitability**
   - The App is provided as-is for moderators who understand and accept that delegated moderation empowers non-moderator users. Evaluate whether this fits your community before enabling it.

2. **User Accountability**
   - Moderation actions are performed by community members who meet defined flair thresholds. The subreddit’s moderators remain responsible for oversight, policy compliance, and resolving disputes.

3. **Rate Limits & Abuse**
   - The App enforces action limits to deter abuse. Exceeding these limits can temporarily ban a user. Communities may need to adjust or disable the App if the defaults are unsuitable.

4. **Data Storage**
   - The App stores minimal action metadata in Reddit’s Devvit KV store (usernames, timestamps, and counters). No personal data beyond Reddit usernames is intentionally collected. Data persists until moderators clear it via the provided menu options.

5. **No Warranty**
   - The App is provided without warranties of any kind. You use it at your own risk. The authors are not liable for moderation mistakes, data loss, or Reddit platform changes that break functionality.

6. **Modifications**
   - You may modify or fork the App, but you are responsible for clearly communicating any changes to your users and complying with Reddit’s rules and the App’s MIT license.

7. **Updates**
   - We may update or discontinue the App at any time. It is your responsibility to keep your installation current and verify that updates meet your community’s needs.

If you do not agree with these terms, do not use the App.

For questions or feedback, contact the maintainers via the Reddit Devs community or the repository issue tracker.
